# Pokemon Battle Arena

## About the Project

![picture of initial game screem](assets/img/)

- I have taken inspiration for creating this game from the very populator Pokémon franchise, in that game a player follows the story of a new trainer building up his skills, catching new Pokémon and battling other trainers with the Pokémon he catches. The specific game that I have created is just the battle part where a player is given the option to fight against another player or they can play against the PC, before this the players or pc will choose their battle Pokémon.

- To do this a player is given the option to review a number of Pokémon. When reviewing the Pokémon it displays the Pokémon type, a description which explains the Pokémon along with their name and the attack moves they can do. This then allows the user to make an informed decision as to the Pokémon they will to have in their battle party. Once the user has chosen their Pokémon, they are taken to the battle area which is where the actually battle takes place. The players will take turn to complete an attack until one of the players Pokémon has a health of 0 (fainted). When the players Pokémon faints, they are then asked to selected another Pokémon from their party, when a player has no more Pokémon in their party the game finishes and the user can either play again against another player or pc. The other option is to exit the game completely.
