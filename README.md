# Pokemon Battle Arena

## About the Project

![picture of initial game screem](assets/img/)

- I have taken inspiration for creating this game from the very popular Pokémon franchise – the aim of which is to build up your skills, catch new Pokémon and battle other trainers with the Pokémon you catch.

- The specific game that I have created is just the battle part, where a player is given the option to fight against another player, or they can play against the PC. I have included an additional feature, in that each player or PC is given the option to choose their battle Pokémon from a pre-defined list which also contains details of the Pokémon. This is important as the attacks executed depend on the Pokémon type that the player has chosen, and the Pokémon type they are fighting. This means the player will need to choose strategically.

- A player is given the option to review a number of different Pokémon. When reviewing the Pokémon, the information provided displays the Pokémon type, includes a description which explains the Pokémon along with their name and the attack moves that they can do. This then allows the user to make an informed decision as to the Pokémon they want to use in their battle party. Once the user has chosen their Pokémon, they are taken to the battle area which is where the actual battle takes place between the selected Pokémon. The battle arena first starts by each player picking an initial Pokémon to fight with, then each player will take turns to complete an attack until one of the players’ Pokémon has a health of 0 (fainted). When the players’ Pokémon faints, they are then asked to select another Pokémon from their battle party to continue the fight. When a player has no more Pokémon in their party, the game finishes and the user can either play again or exit the game. If they wish to play again, they will be asked if this is against a human player or the PC.
